# Parents list
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


Let's print all the elements that are parents of the `cite` element to the console.

We want to print them as a string in the following format:

```
html > body > main > section > blockquote > footer > cite
```

_don't forget the separator "`>`" between the tag names_

We want the string to start from the outermost parent and continue to the element `cite` we started from.

<!-- Extra: Can you also add to the same string the classes each parent has, for example: `section.page > blockquote`. -->
